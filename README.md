# Forest vs Building Classification Using ANN

This project focuses on classifying images as either "forest" or "building" using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The goal is to develop a machine learning system capable of distinguishing between images containing natural landscapes (forests) and images containing man-made structures (buildings).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of forests and buildings. The images are divided into two classes: "forest" and "building". The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with a split of 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## Neural Network Architecture

The chosen architecture for the ANN model is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn relevant features from the input data.

The CNN architecture used for this project consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers to downsample the spatial dimensions. The output from the last convolutional layer is flattened and fed into a fully connected layer, which is then connected to the output layer with a softmax activation function to produce the final classification probabilities.

## Training

The model is trained using the training set of labeled images. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the classification error. The optimization algorithm used is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32.

The training process involves iterating over the training set for a specified number of epochs. At each epoch, the model computes the loss between its predicted outputs and the true labels, and then backpropagates the gradients to update the model's parameters.

## Evaluation

After training the model, its performance is evaluated using the testing set of labeled images. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify forest and building images.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code for this project:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
- Keras (version >= 2.0)
- NumPy (version >= 1.0)
- Matplotlib (version >= 3.0)

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed above.
3. Prepare your dataset by organizing the images into separate folders for "forest" and "building" classes.
4. Update the paths to the training and testing datasets in the code.
5. Run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.

```bash
python forest_vs_building_classification.py
```

## Results

After training and evaluation, the model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the testing set. The precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to be 0.89, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. These results indicate that the model performs well in distinguishing between forest and building images.

## Further Improvements

There are several ways to further improve the performance of the forest vs building classification model:

- Augment the dataset: Increase the diversity of the dataset by applying random transformations to the images, such as rotations, flips, and translations.
- Experiment with different architectures: Try different CNN architectures, including variations of the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, to find a model that better suits the dataset.
- Fine-tuning: Utilize pre-trained models, such as VGG or ResNet, and perform fine-tuning on the last few layers to leverage their learned features.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to find the best combination for improved performance.

By incorporating these improvements, the model's accuracy and overall performance can potentially be enhanced.
